Create a new Unity project:

Open Unity Hub and click on the "New" button.
Select the Unity version you want to use and choose a project name and location.
Click on the "Create" button.
Import the AR Foundation package:

In Unity, go to the "Window" menu and select "Package Manager".
In the package manager, search for "AR Foundation".
Click on the "Install" button to install the package.
Import the ARCore or ARKit package depending on which platform you want to develop for:

In Unity, go to the "Window" menu and select "Package Manager".
In the package manager, search for "ARCore" or "ARKit" depending on the platform.
Click on the "Install" button to install the package.
Create a new scene:

In Unity, go to the "File" menu and select "New Scene".
Save the scene with a name of your choice.
Add the AR Session and AR Session Origin prefabs:

In the Project window, go to "Assets" > "Packages" > "AR Foundation" > "Prefabs".
Drag the "AR Session" and "AR Session Origin" prefabs into the Hierarchy window.
Add the AR Plane Manager component to the AR Session Origin game object:

In the Hierarchy window, select the "AR Session Origin" game object.
In the Inspector window, click on the "Add Component" button.
Search for "AR Plane Manager" and select it to add the component.
Set up the AR Plane Manager:

In the Inspector window, expand the "AR Plane Manager" component.
Set the "Detection Flags" to "Horizontal" to only detect horizontal planes.
Set the "Plane Prefab" to a plane prefab of your choice.
Set the "Maximum Plane Count" to a value of your choice.
Run the project:

Click on the "Play" button in the Unity Editor to run the project.
Move your device around to scan for planes.
Once a plane is detected, the plane prefab should be instantiated in the scene.
To detect the pool table, you can follow these steps:

Place a pool table image or a video of a pool table in the Assets folder.
Create a new script and attach it to the AR Session Origin game object.
In the script, use the ARTrackedImageManager component to detect the pool table image or video and instantiate a 3D model of the pool table at the detected image or video location.
I hope this helps you get started with Unity and plane detection. Let me know if you have any questions or need further guidance.
